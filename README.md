configs
=======

storing / sharing various config files

- .vimrc & .vim folder : vim config
    + Did use it for rails dev.
- .bash_profile (prompt showing git)
- .bashrc : just as a reminder for 
    + export of vim as EDITOR
- .profile 
    + includes useful alias for my git usage
- gitconfig 
    + used on mint16. more of a reminder.
    Nothing fancy there yet.
